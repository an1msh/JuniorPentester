Some useful scripts maybe.

The script is a bash script that is used to find subdomains and assets for a given root domain. It does this by using the subfinder tool to find subdomains, and the assetfinder tool to find assets associated with the root domain. It then uses the altdns tool to generate additional subdomains based on the initial list of subdomains and assets. Finally, it checks which of the generated subdomains resolve using the host command and saves the ones that resolve to a file called resolved-subdomains.txt.
